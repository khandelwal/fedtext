The Earth\u2019s surface, clouds, and the atmosphere then re-emit part of this absorbed solar energy as heat. The infrared channel senses this re-emitted radiation. Infrared imagery is useful for determining cloud features both at day and night.", "Water vapor imagery", "is used to analyze the presence and movement of water vapor moisture in the upper and middle levels of the atmosphere. The wavelength spectrum used to detect water vapor is in the 6.7 to 7.3 micrometer wavelength range. The darker regions in water vapor imagery are areas where very little water vapor exists in the middle and upper troposphere, and the lighter regions are very moist. Water vapor imagery is a very valuable tool for weather analysis and prediction because water vapor imagery shows moisture in the atmosphere, not just cloud patterns.  This allows meteorologists to observe large-scale circulation patterns even when clouds are not present.", "NOAA Weather Constellation", "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintains two primary constellations of environmental satellites: geostationary and polar-orbiting. These satellites are part of NOAA's integrated observing system, which includes satellites, radar, surface automated weather stations, weather balloons, sounders, buoys, instrumented aircraft and other sensors, along with the data management infrastructure needed for this system.", "Geostationary Satellites", "Geostationary satellites orbit 35,800 km (22,300 miles) above Earth's equator at speeds equal to Earth's rotation, which means they maintain their positions and provide continuous coverage. Information from geostationary satellites is used for short-term (1 day) weather forecasting and severe storm warning and tracking.", "Polar-Orbiting Satellites", "Polar-orbiting satellites make regular orbits around the Earth\u2019s poles from about 833 km (517 miles) above the Earth\u2019s surface. The Earth constantly rotates counterclockwise underneath the path of the satellite, making for a different view with each orbit. Information from polar-orbiting satellites is used for mid-range (3-7 day) forecasts and advanced warnings of severe weather.", "GOES View of Earth", "GOES satellites continually view the continental United States, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, Central and South America, and Southern Canada. To fully cover Alaska, Hawaii, the entire continental United States and the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (for tropical storms), NOAA operates two GOES satellites simultaneously: GOES-East and GOES-West. GOES East is located at 75\u00b0 W and provides most of the U.S. weather information. GOES West is located at 135\u00b0W over the Pacific Ocean. In the GOES-R series era, GOES West will be located at 137\u00b0W. In addition to two operational satellites, NOAA also maintains an on-orbit spare.", "Constant Improvement", "Since 1975, GOES have provided continuous imagery and data on atmospheric conditions and solar activity (space weather). They have even aided in search and rescue of people in distress. GOES data products have led to more accurate and timely weather forecasts and better understanding of long-term climate conditions. NASA builds and launches the satellites and NOAA operates them.", "GOES-R Series Launches", "GOES-R, scheduled for launch in November 2016, will be followed by GOES-S in 2018, GOES-T in 2019 and GOES-U in 2024.The GOES-R series will extend the availability of the operational GOES satellite system through 2036.", "More Details", "NOAA Satellite Missions", "Two Orbits, One Mission", "GOES\r\n         History", "Launch and Orbit", "Previous Highlight Panel", "Close Panel", "Next Highlight Panel", "The GOES-R satellite will", "launch on November 4, 2016 at 21:40 GMT (5:40 EDT)", "from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, aboard an Atlas V 541 rocket.", "Once GOES-R is launched it will be placed in the 89.5 \u00b0 checkout orbit where it will undergo an extended checkout and validation phase of approximately one year. The satellite will transition to operations immediately afterward. GOES-R will be known as GOES-16 once operational.", "GOES-R\u2019s operational orbit has not yet been determined. The final decision will be based on the health/safety/performance of the GOES constellation. NOAA\u2019s Office of Satellite and Product Operations will be responsible for determining the operational orbit for GOES-R.", "GOES satellites are placed into a geosynchronous orbit", "which is an orbit that keeps the satellite over a specific location on the earth. By maintaining a position hovering over fixed point on the Earth's surface, GOES will be able to constantly monitor atmospheric conditions in a particular portion of the Earth's atmosphere.

L. 111-148), ERRP provided financial assistance for employment-based health plan sponsors to help early retirees and their spouses, surviving spouses, and dependents maintain access to quality, affordable health coverage. \u00a0Plan sponsors that were accepted into the program could receive reinsurance reimbursement for a portion of the claims for health benefits for early retirees age 55 and older who were not eligible for Medicare, and their spouses, surviving spouses, and dependents.", "Program Participation", "What types of organizations participated?", "Commercial, non-profit, union, and religious organizations, as well as state and local governments,", "3", "participated in the ERRP. \u00a0State and local governments, the largest of which are more likely than the largest private employers to offer retiree health benefits,", "4", "represented the slight majority of the nearly 2,900 sponsors that received ERRP reimbursement. \u00a0Participating plan sponsors of this type included States or government subdivisions (e.g., counties, cities, and special districts), school districts, or organizations representing government employees (e.g., teachers and police officers). \u00a0All types of plan sponsors attempted to maintain affordable health coverage for their active employees and early retirees, while continuing to meet demands for their products and services. \u00a0ERRP proved to be a critical source of support by benefiting early retirees, their family members, other plan participants, and the health plan sponsors that provided vital access to health coverage. \u00a0As the program was implemented during the economic recession, there was a significant response from sponsors of retiree health plans.", "How much reimbursement did the participating organizations receive?", "ERRP provided nearly $5 billion in reinsurance payments to approximately 2,900 employers and other sponsors of retiree plans.", "5", "The size of health plans for which plan sponsors received reimbursements varied significantly.

The content for this playlist is: Black and white shot of a woman speaking to her camera. WOMAN: I'm doing this. A man stands in a room, playing an acoustic guitar and singing. NARRATOR: Born in a black and white world, we saw color in the mirror. Two hands hold up a white sheet of fabric with the words \"LOVE IS FOR EVERYONE\" painted on it. Outdoors, someone holds up a flag as they run. Then, the black and white shot becomes colorful, revealing the flag to be rainbow. A person with dramatic black eye makeup on looks downward close to their camera as they press a small makeup brush to their nose. NARRATOR: Our sexuality, our gender, our identity were never quite understood. A person with long blonde hair and makeup on speaks to their camera. Close-up shot of two people walking side-by-side, holding each other's hands. A person with short, curly, brown hair speaks to their camera. PERSON: I am transgender. NARRATOR: But we eventually found love for our own truth. A woman and a boy stand next to each other in a kitchen, facing the camera but speaking to each other. The woman gets up to hug the boy as he begins to cry. WOMAN: You're gay? That's okay, hon. I love you no matter what in the world. Various quick shots show someone proposing marriage to another person, two men hugging in the middle of a dark room, a couple with their child, one kissing the other on the cheek, a woman smiling at her camera, two women sitting together on a couch, two men hugging each other closely in a bedroom, a woman speaking to her camera, someone riding a bicycle with a large pink and blue flag flying behind them, a woman in colorful clothing dancing outdoors, two people getting married, one kissing the other on the cheek, a man speaking to his camera, and multiple very quick shots of people being outdoors and smiling and celebrating. NARRATOR: And now joy is on the horizon. Health and happiness--these are our new destinations. But a factor that seems casual to some in the community can get in our way. Like tobacco. A fade from black to multiple shots of a crowd of people inside a crowded club or bar. NARRATOR: Yes, that moment at the bar, the occasional cigarette, it can undermine our future. Smoking can damage nearly every part of our bodies. A man walks into a convenience store and hands the cashier a $20 bill. NARRATOR: Its addiction siphons money from our pockets, and it claims tens of thousands of LGBT lives every year. A woman pulls a pack of cigarettes from her purse. The man takes a cigarette from a pack and puts the pack in his back pocket. Another man stands against a wall and takes a cigarette from a pack. Multiple videos of various people speaking to their cameras forms a collage. NARRATOR: So why now inflict this damage to ourselves? Multiple shots of people with rainbow articles of clothing celebrating and smiling outdoors. NARRATOR: No. This new life free from judgment, free from the shadows will also be free from tobacco. A final shot of a woman carrying a rainbow flag behind her zooms out back to the collage of videos. Purple brush strokes paint the This Free Life logo onto the screen, followed by black brush strokes that cover the shot behind the logo. ANNOUNCER: This Free Life, freedom to be tobacco-free.

Considerable progress in addressing problems of crime, disorder, and violence has occurred since the nation experienced peaks of violent crime in the 1980s and early 1990s (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2008). Research suggests that innovative law enforcement practices based on data-driven problem solving, enhanced collaboration and partnerships, and focused enforcement have contributed to improved public safety and reduced crime (see e.g., Boston Gun Project \u2013 Braga et al., 2001; Kennedy et al., 2001; SACSI \u2013 McGarrell et al., 2006; Roehl et al., 2008; Corsaro and McGarrell, 2009; Corsaro and McGarrell, 2010; McGarrell et al. 2010). The Research Partner Orientation course (RPOC) is intended to support the more effective integration of the research partner into crime and violence reduction task forces/cross sector partnerships like PSN. The RPOC provides background on the evolution of the action research approach as well as specific elements of the Research Partner model (e.g., problem assessment, linking to evidence-based practice, ongoing assessment, and evaluation). With this foundation in place, the RPOC then works through the key components of making the partnership succeed. This is followed by a module on best practices for violence reduction as well as information on technical assistance to support the Research Partnership as well as the overall PSN initiative.

As such, the survey focuses on issues that relate to the direction community corrections is taking, the influence policymakers and the public have in determining that direction, and the resources needed to address new and anticipated priorities. The survey also provided CCCN an opportunity to determine if it is working on policy and issue areas that association memberships consider priorities Results show that the field embraces key elements of the new approach CCCN says the field needs to take: Key benchmarks include increasing reliance on evidence-based practices, research and data driven approaches.

T4C incorporates research from cognitive restructuring theory, social skills development, and the learning and use of problem solving skills.\r\n\r\nT4C is comprised of 25 lessons that build upon each other, and contains appendices that can be used to craft an aftercare program to meet ongoing cognitive behavioral needs of your group. Not all lessons can be completed in one session, so a typical delivery cycle may take 30 sessions. Sessions should last between one and two hours. Ideally, the curriculum is delivered two times per week, with a minimum recommended dosage of once per week and a maximum of three times per week. Participants must be granted time to complete mandatory homework between each lesson.\r\n\r\nThe program is designed to be provided to justice-involved adults and youth, males and females. It is intended for groups of eight to twelve and should be delivered only by trained facilitators. Due to its integrated structure, T4C is a closed group, meaning members need to start at the beginning of a cycle, and may not join the group mid-stream (lesson five is a logical cut-off point for new group members).\r\n\r\nT4C is provided by corrections professionals in prisons, jails, detention centers, community corrections, probation, and parole settings. The National Institute of Corrections has trained more than 10,000 individuals as T4C group facilitators, and more than 500 trainers who can train additional staff to facilitate the program with justice-involved clients.\r\n\r\nT4C 4.0 represents a significant evolution in the curriculum, both in content and use. It is the most sincere hope of NIC and the authors that the changes enable you and your agency to better serve your clients. Correctional agencies can consider Thinking for a Change as one option in a continuum of interventions to address the cognitive, social, and emotional needs of their client populations\u2019.", "New in the Library", "Restrictive Housing: An Annotated Bibliography 2016", "Posted: 4 weeks ago", "(2016) Resources about the use of restricted housing are provided and organized according to: resources from NIC; prevalence of restrictive housing; governing practices and policies; the basis for and process involved in determining whether, and for how long, someone is placed in special housing; conditions of confinement\u2014juveniles, and female offenders; research\u2014effects of prolonged confinement; legislation and litigation impacts; programming and reentry-focused services; availability of medical and mental health services; safe alternatives and step-down programs; Resources about the use of restricted housing are provided and organized according to: resources from NIC; prevalence of restrictive housing; governing practices and policies; the basis for and process involved in determining whether, and for how long, someone is placed in special housing; conditions of confinement\u2014juveniles, and female offenders; research\u2014effects of prolonged confinement; litigation; programming and reentry-focused services; availability of medical and mental health services; safe alternatives and step-down programs.", "New in the Library", "Wisconsin Department of Corrections Interactive Dashboards", "Posted: 4 weeks ago", "(2016) Access is provided to three interactive dashboards from the Division of Adult Institutions (DAI) of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections\u2014Admissions to Prison, Releases from Prison, and Prison Point-in-Time Populations.
